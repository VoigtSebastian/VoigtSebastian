## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sebastian and I'm a M.Sc. CS student at the HTWG Konstanz.
I'm currently writing my master thesis "**LLM-Based Agents for Autonomous Knowledge Retrieval: Finding and Summarizing Proprietary Knowledge Using RAG and ReAct Patterns**", where I'm researching possible architectures and design patterns of autonomous LLM agents.

You can reach me by sending a mail to [my university address](mailto:Sebastian.Voigt@htwg-konstanz.de).

### Background
I started working as a software developer in the third semester of my bachelor's degree and haven't stopped since.
Most of the time I worked at the Swiss Library Service Platform, but I have since moved to Seitenbau to work on my master's thesis.

I've worked professionally with **Scala**, **Java** and **Python**, while also using **C++** and **Rust** in my studies.
