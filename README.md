Hello there!
I'm Sebastian, and I work at [SEITENBAU](www.seitenbau.com) as a software developer focusing on AI infrastructure.
I also have a Master's degree in Computer Science.
I finished my Master's degree in June 2025 by handing in my thesis, called 'An LLM-Based Multi-Source Retrieval Agent for Enhanced Knowledge Management'.
The thesis reflects my research into the possible architectures and design patterns of autonomous LLM agents.
You can find the published version of it on [GitHub](https://github.com/VoigtSebastian/master-thesis).

## Background
I started working as a software developer in my third semester of my Bachelor's degree to finance my studies.
I mostly worked at the [Swiss Library Service Platform (SLSP)](https://slsp.ch/), but I have since moved to work for SEITENBAU during and after writing my master's thesis.

I have worked professionally with Python, Scala and Java, and have also used C/C++ and Rust extensively in my studies.
